Clone or Download inside a REPOs folder at Home User Directory.

In the folder "Main_files" there are two *.m files for running the code (main.m) and creating the post-process (main_plot.m).

Pre-processing is made with GiD (www.gidhome.com).

Post-processing can be made with Gid, Paraview or the own MatLab software.

Details are collected in the Handbook folder.
